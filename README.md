Hey, I’m Nathan  
Amazon scaler turned AI explorer, building with LLaMA.  

## Projects  
- [Task Engine Marketplace](https://github.com/onepequity/llama-task-engine-marketplace): Open-source AI solutions for all.  
- [LLaMA Customer Feedback Engine](https://github.com/onepequity/llama-sentiment-analysis): Sentiment analysis made simple.  

## Contributions
- Contributed to [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/149835) by clarifying tensor definition in README.

## Vision  
Open-source AI for everyone—Task Engines bridge the gap.

## AI Ecosystem Insights
LLaMA’s collaboration with AWS leverages SageMaker and EC2 for scalable AI deployment, but faces challenges like tech lift and ecosystem support compared to proprietary models. My Task Engine Store addresses this by providing pre-tuned LLaMA models, reducing setup complexity and enhancing trustworthiness through open-source deployment.
