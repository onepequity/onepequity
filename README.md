Hey, I’m Nathan  
Amazon scaler turned AI explorer, building with LLaMA.  

## Projects  
- [Task Engine Marketplace](https://github.com/onepequity/llama-task-engine-marketplace): Open-source AI solutions for all.  
- [LLaMA Customer Feedback Engine](https://github.com/onepequity/llama-sentiment-analysis): Sentiment analysis made simple.  

## Contributions
- Contributed to [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/149835) by clarifying tensor definition in README.

## Vision  
Open-source AI for everyone—Task Engines bridge the gap.

## AI Ecosystem Insights
LLaMA’s collaboration with AWS leverages SageMaker and EC2 for scalable AI deployment, but faces challenges like tech lift and ecosystem support compared to proprietary models. My Task Engine Store addresses this by providing pre-tuned LLaMA models, reducing setup complexity and enhancing trustworthiness through open-source deployment.

- Explored LLaMA’s role in industry alliances and regulatory compliance in [LLaMA Ecosystem Insights](https://github.com/onepequity/llama-ecosystem-insights), providing strategic recommendations for enterprise adoption.

## Why I’m a Fit
- Explosive Growth at Amazon: Took the B2B GPO Partnership Program from a stagnant 15% YoY growth before my arrival to an unprecedented 169% YoY growth, scaling it by $1.191B and exceeding forecasts by $191M. Remarkably, I accomplished this using only 5% of team resources, yet contributed 40% of the department’s overall growth—a testament to my ability to maximize impact efficiently.
- Compliance and Regulatory Expertise: Mastered cooperative purchasing contracts to tackle public sector compliance, unlocking government accounts and slashing approval times by 175%, which is invaluable for AI partnerships in regulated industries.
- Tech-Savvy with AI Tools: Harnessed AWS, SageMaker, Bedrock, and LLMs to develop customized solutions, aligning perfectly with the AI ecosystem expertise this role demands.
- Cross-Functional Leadership: Directed cross-functional teams to generate over $300M in incremental revenue, collaborating seamlessly with AWS, Ring, and other tech units.
- Agility and Innovation: Delivered a 338% boost in sales productivity at Alpheus Communications and grew enterprise contracts by 30% during Windstream’s Chapter 11 restructuring, proving I thrive in high-stakes, dynamic settings.
