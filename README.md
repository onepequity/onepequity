Hey, I’m Nathan  
Amazon scaler turned AI explorer, building with LLaMA.

Why I’m a Fit  
- Explosive Growth at Amazon: Took the B2B GPO Partnership Program from 15% to 169% YoY growth, scaling it by $1.191B with just 5% of team resources.  
- Compliance and Regulatory Expertise: Slashed approval times by 175% through mastery of public sector contracts, perfect for AI in regulated industries.  
- Tech-Savvy with AI Tools: Built solutions with AWS, SageMaker, and LLMs, aligning with this role’s needs.  
- Cross-Functional Leadership: Generated $300M+ in revenue across AWS and Ring teams.  
- Agility and Innovation: Boosted sales productivity by 338% and grew contracts by 30% in tough settings.
- AI-Driven Partnerships: Used AWS Titan to analyze customer feedback for Amazon Business, proving partner involvement boosted trust and satisfaction. This data-driven approach enhanced partner adoption by 50%, contributing to $300M+ in revenue.
- Navigating Cross-Functional Priorities: Leveraged LLaMA’s trust advantages to shift AWS sales reps’ recommendations from Titan to LLaMA, aligning their compute/storage sales goals with customer trust needs, and opening opportunities for LLaMA’s enterprise adoption.

Vision  
Open-source AI for everyone—Task Engines make LLaMA accessible and scalable.

AI Ecosystem Insights  
LLaMA’s AWS integration (SageMaker, EC2) enables scalable AI, but setup complexity is a hurdle. My Task Engine Store simplifies this with pre-tuned models.

Vision for LLaMA in Public Sector and Secure Environments  
My compliance expertise (175% faster approvals) proves LLaMA’s fit for regulated industries—its transparency and on-premises hosting make it the gold standard for secure AI.
Data Privacy Commitment: Advocate for LLaMA’s on-premises deployment to ensure data sovereignty and compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), aligning with industry priorities for secure AI in regulated sectors.
